                    <p className="itemp" >
                        There is a wide range of symptoms that may be attributed to adrenal fatigue such as chronique low energy, depression low tolerance to stress, intolerance to cold, When decision-making becomes impossible and when pink boots a strain on you. No energy in the morning to start the day and a paradoxical difficulty to unwind in the evening to relax and find sleep at bed time.
                        When you find yourself exhausted in social situations and you see that they drain a lot of your energy when other people are actually doing okay. When you see that it takes you substantially longer to recover from stressful events than it used to in the past. When you see that you're just not bouncing back.

                    <h2 id="why">Factors that cause a strain on adrenal health</h2>


                    <p className="itemp">
                        Adrenal fatigue typically happens when you've put too much strain on your adaptability for too long, you have depleted your energy.
                        There is a number of factors that can put a strain on your adrenal glands like too much physical or mental adaptation, solicitation for too long without the needed recovery time.
                        The body has to adapt when not given enough sleep, overworked, lack of nutrients, cold, hot, pressure, activity, lack of physical activity, basically anything that sets it out of balance for too long.

                    <h2 id="how">What can I do to get stronger?</h2>
                    <ul className="ulp">
                        <li> Hormesis</li>
                        <li> rest</li>
                        <li> change the conditions that led to the adrenals depletion</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p className="itemp">
                        What is Hormesis? Hormesis is a biological phenomenon in which a low dose of a potentially harmful agent stimulates an adaptive response that results in improved health and increased resistance to future stressors.</p>
                    <p className="itemp">   
                        In plain words that means that the body should be stimulated, challenged but always within its limits and those limits are different for everyone.
                        Small challenges followed by periods of rest/ anabolism are necessary to improve adrenals function. The idea is to challenge those limits progressively and learn how to listen to our body and emotions not to be carried away and go too far.
                        If you challenge yourself within your limits you get stronger, if you challenge yourself too much you are going to deplete your adrenals further and this is detrimental.</p>
                    <p className="itemp">
                        When people need to work on their adrenals, it is necessary to determine honestly what contributed/ contributes to the nervous strain their nervous system is/ was under. Is it strain at work? A family situation? Too much partying? Too much online gaming? Excess in a competitive physical activity? Unhealthy habits? College Exams?
                        Even in the cases where the adrenal state is a result of heredity, an effort will have to be made for the situation to improve. One way to start is learning to relax, unwind and adopting a healthy lifestyle with proper sleep, food and physical activity.

                            A number of plants  and supplements are usually used to help the adrenal glands
                            adaptogens like rhodiola, nettle, ashwaganda, siberian ginseng... If you don't have high blood pressure licorice is a great plant for low adrenals. Schizandra is a great adaptogen and is also good for the pituitary gland.

                        Yes you did the job. Do you have reformed your diet you have taken steps to reform your lifestyle, you've started a cleaning journey not only cleaning your bowels, your skin and your physical body.. Now is the time to go a little bit deeper.
                        You've taken care of the toxins in your body, now is the time to take care of the toxins in your soul. What thoughts, behaviours and attitude are actually toxic? How  have  you caused harm to other people? what is toxic or what was toxic in your behaviour and your thought process?</p>
                    <p className="itemp">     
                        Now is the time to reflect and think about your thoughts, deeds. It's time To make amends, to repent. Once you find it in yourself to fully take responsibility and see yourself in your integrity both the good and not so good you can really start healing. Life is full of teachings it's not meant to hurt for no reason, there is a lesson to be learnt.
                        you will start to heal when you gather the strength to look inside and look at the wounds that are hurting your soul. It certainly isn't about judging, it's about acknowledging what is and take responsibility. Think about your thought process as a very smooth healing touch filled with light and love.</p>
                    <p className="itemp">   
                        As my mentor Thierry Casasnovas explained In a video, talking about his personal experience of his healing process: he was reflecting about the wrongs he inflicted upon people in the past.  He tells how he made a list of the people he had wronged in the past and how he reached out to them to express he was sorry and to make amends and this is when he says he truly really started healing
                        We live in a materialistic world that tends to remove, deprive the soul of its reality and it's wrong because your soul is really not only a part of you but may be the only real you. If you're reading these lines, chances are your soul is in pain.
